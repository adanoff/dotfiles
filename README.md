# adanoff does dotfiles

Forked from [holman/dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles), which has
lots more information about installation, how it all works, motivation, etc if
you're interested.

## Things I changed

* holman using zsh + me using bash = compatability issues [FIXED]
* Tailored existing dotfiles for my use

## Things I added

* Neovim dotfiles

## Philosophy

Read holman's excellent post about [forking
dotfiles](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/)
